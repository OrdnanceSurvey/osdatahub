Once you have copied the API we suggest following best practices and storing it as an environment variable - for this tutorial we store the API key as an environment variable called `OS_API_KEY`. Creating an environment variable is beyond the scope of this tutorial but you can find examples of how to do this online.\r\n",

    "<span style=\"color: red\">You can use `osdatahub` without setting an enviroment variable - this approach is also shown below - but this is discouraged. If you choose to use the paste the API directly into your sode make sure you don't have it publicly accessible.</span>\r\n",
